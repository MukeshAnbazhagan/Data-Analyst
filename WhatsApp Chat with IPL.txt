12/26/22, 19:50 - Udhayan: so how did the auction go this year ?
12/26/22, 19:51 - Mukesh: Only few players got auctioned for higher prizes
12/26/22, 19:52 - Aanandh Sret: Bro Price*😂
12/26/22, 19:53 - Mukesh: my bad😂😂
12/26/22, 19:53 - Aanandh Sret: Which player went for highest price?
12/26/22, 19:54 - Mukesh: The highest bid was taken by punjab kings for Sam Curran
12/26/22, 19:55 - Aanandh Sret: ⚡⚡
12/26/22, 19:55 - Aanandh Sret: He went for around 19c right?
12/26/22, 19:56 - Udhayan: to be exact he was bided  for 18.5 crores
12/26/22, 19:57 - Mukesh: No 18.5 crores💪
12/26/22, 19:58 - Aanandh Sret: Fine!
12/26/22, 19:58 - Koushik Itachi: Curran's selling price surpassed the record set by rajasthan royals when the side had bid 16.25 crore for Chris Morris in 2021 season
12/26/22, 19:58 - Aanandh Sret: Great 👍🏻
12/26/22, 19:59 - Mukesh: Sam curren is not worth for 18.5 crores
12/26/22, 20:01 - Udhayan: yea his batting form was not good in the last T20 world cup
12/26/22, 20:03 - Aanandh Sret: Yes correct, ben stokes deserves much price than Sam Curran.since he have great records when compare to sam
12/26/22, 20:03 - Koushik Itachi: I agree 👍💯
12/26/22, 20:06 - Mukesh: Cameron Green also crossed the mark with MI agreeing to a INR 17.5 crore deal with the Aussie.❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
12/26/22, 20:07 - Koushik Itachi: West Indies’ Nicholas Pooran became the most expensive wicketkeeper ever, going for eight times his base price to LSG at INR 16 crore ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
12/26/22, 20:09 - Aanandh Sret: I guess Cameron green is overrated , since we have less experience in Indian pitch
12/26/22, 20:09 - Aanandh Sret: He*
12/26/22, 20:10 - Mukesh: Already LSG have a very good wicket keeping batsman. So i think he'll be benched for most of the matches😂🤦‍♂️
12/27/22, 20:31 - Mukesh: Guys what's your prediction on this year's orange cap and purple cap? 🤔🤔
12/27/22, 20:33 - Koushik Itachi: I think kl Rahul will win orange cap and kagiso rabada will win purple cap
12/27/22, 20:34 - Mukesh: No kl rahul is not in good form
12/27/22, 20:34 - Mukesh: I think Kohli will win the orange cap💪🔥
12/27/22, 20:36 - Aanandh Sret: I guess devon Conway
12/27/22, 20:36 - Koushik Itachi: 💥🔥🔥
12/27/22, 20:42 - Mukesh: yeah I'll also agree.. Because last year he did well for csk

12/27/22, 20:44 - Aanandh Sret: Bhuvi
12/27/22, 20:44 - Mukesh: I think sam curren will win purple cap💪
12/27/22, 20:44 - Aanandh Sret: Nope
12/27/22, 20:44 - Koushik Itachi: 🔥🔥
12/27/22, 20:45 - Mukesh: bhuvi only takes initial wickets in the power play.. So i thinks it's not possible
12/27/22, 20:47 - Aanandh Sret: 🤔🤔
12/27/22, 20:48 - Koushik Itachi: Who will be underperformer of the upcoming season ?
